                        People on the Internet, television, and places such as school and the workplace can be discourteous to each other. For example, if you watch videos online, there is always a troll in the comments section being extremely rude to others or not expressing their opinion in a well-mannered way. The way these trolls behave is disrespectful and they cause disharmony in the online community in which they are participating.
        
                        I feel it is important to respect people, even people you might not particularly like. Not being respectful can show that you have poor character, are closed-minded.
